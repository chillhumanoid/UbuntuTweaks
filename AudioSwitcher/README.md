# AudioSwitcher
I have speakers and headphones that i got tired of unplugging and switching.
So I've started setting up this script to have a hotkey that switches the audiofeed

## Considerations
So the first thing I noticed was that alsamixer doesn't seem to care if
they are two different outputs.
