# AudioSwitcher
I have speakers and headphones that i got tired of unplugging and switching.
So I've started setting up this script to have a hotkey that switches the audiofeed

## Considerations
assumes card name is generic
assumes that only 3 possible options for card ID

## To Use:
download speakers.sh and move to /usr/local/bin/speakers.sh
chmod +X speakers.sh
add a keyboard shortcut to binding of your choice and set command as "speakers.sh"
