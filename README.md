## AudioSwitcher
I realize now this may not be necessary at all, but I had just messed up my alsa-mixer settings. Still, handy if you're having issues with the audio mixer

## Accountable2YouFocal.sh
I use an accountability software that hasn't updated to use python 3.8, so this script installs everything needed to have the software run on Ubuntu 20.04 until they update their software. 

Make sure to 
```chmod +x Accountable2YouFocal.sh```

and then run the script as sudo
```sudo ./Accountable2YouFocal.sh```
