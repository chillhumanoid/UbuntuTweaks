## AudioSwitcher
I realize now this may not be necessary at all, but I had just messed up my alsa-mixer settings. Still, handy if you're having issues with the audio mixer

## Accountable2YouFocal.sh
I use an accountability software that hasn't updated to use python 3.8, so this script installs everything needed to have the software run on Ubuntu 20.04 until they update their software. 

### Installation Instructions
```$ wget https://github.com/chillhumanoid/UbuntuTweaks/blob/master/Accountable2YouFocal.sh
$ chmod +x Accountable2YouFocal.sh
$ sudo ./Accountable2YouFocal.sh
```
Allow for 30-40 minutes to compile python
